# Joachim's brew tools

This repository contains a number of tools that help me in my brewing and documenting workflow. 

## `brewxml2md`

This tool parses a [BeerXML Recipe](http://www.beerxml.com/beerxml.htm) and converts it to markdown. This can then be imported into your note-taking software of choice.
